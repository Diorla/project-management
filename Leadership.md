# Power

There are different type of power that you may have as a leader. It's important to know which you have and how to use them

## 1. Legitimate power

This is a formal authority given to you in your profession or certain position within an organisation. It is legally yours and product of hierarchical structure.

## 2. Reward power

This is an ability to give people what they wish or want if they follow your instruction. This is sort of a quid-pro-quo situation like promotions, awards or pay rises. This is good for building allegiance, keeping morale high and enable bonding

## 3. Expert power

This is a power that comes from certain knowledge or skills on certain situation or subject. In this situation, you earn respect and trust from colleagues based on your credibility.

## 4. Referent power

This is the ability to influence people through personality and attractiveness. Referent power is gotten when you inspire qualities like respect, honesty, integrity and trust in your colleagues. This is most seen in charismatic leaders, who excels at making others feel comfortable in their presence.

## 5. Coercive power

This is the power to convince people to do something, usually using unethical force or threat. This includes things like demotion, possible dismissals. This may be used positively to maintain standards and increase productivity

## 6. Informational power

This is based on the control of information, for example knowing someone's confidential financial report or health report. This information may be used through concealment, manipulation, distortion or revealment of such information. Information can be used as bargaining tool, or provide insight into colleagues that may be helpful in negotiation.

## 7. Connection power

This is based on attaining influence through networking. Forging connection with powerful individuals can give us certain powers and enable us to get certain things done through our network.

## 8. Moral power

This is the ability to inspire actions based on a set of values or beliefs. They inspire loyalty because they emulate actions and beliefs that the followers aspire to have.

## 9. Political power

Political power is inherent in a social group where certain members of the group are given the power to make decisions. It is a social product, that determines the capacities, actions and beliefs of the members of the group. Eventually, in a group, one or more members take lead, whether formally or informally recognised and the limit of the power depends on the group dynamics

## 10. Founder power

This is power given to a creator of an organisation, this may be legitimate control or perceived, like having deeper knowledge about the organisation and having the best interest of the organisation.
