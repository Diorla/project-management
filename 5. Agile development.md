## Difference between Agile and Waterfall

![Agile vs Waterfall](./asset/waterfall_vs_agile.png)

## Agile manifesto

It could be found [here](https://agilemanifesto.org/)

- **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation
- **Responding to change** over following a plan

### The principles behind the Agile Manifesto

Full principles can be found [here](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). Below are the summaries

- Continuous delivery
- Welcome change in requirements
- Deliver frequently in small doses
- Business people and developers should work side by side
- Motivation is important
- Face-to-face conversation is the best
- A working software is best measurement of progress
- It's important to maintain const pace, indefinitely
- Continuous attention to excellence
- Simplicity is essential
- Good work comes from a team that coordinate itself
- Regular reflection is important

### VUCA

VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. VUCA defines the conditions that affect organizations in a changing and complex world and helps teams account for these changes in projects.

## Scrum

This is the most popular implementation of Agile methodologies. It requires the following as described [here](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game):
- Built-in instability: Dynamic enough to handle challenging situations
- Self-organizing teams: lacks true hierarchy
- Overlapping development phases: A collective pace where the worst performer is not far behind the best performer. Everybody is in sync
- Multi-learning: Trial and error, staying up to date and responding quickly to changes and new information
- Subtle control: Though it lacks true hierarchy, leadership is still there but shouldn't hinder creativity
- Organizational transfer of learning: learn something new and be ready to support other team members to learn as well

## Spotify model

The full description of the model can be found [here](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf). So what it boils down to is the following

- Squads
- Tribes
- Chapters
- Guild

### Squad

It's a unit, like a scrum team or a small startup, they work on a long  term mission and usually focus on one aspect of Spotify. They do not have a leader but have a product owner that communicates with other product owners to ensure collaboration and track Spotify progress as a whole. So we can have a squad in charge of web-dev and other squad in charge of android dev and another squad in charge of backend or payment service. Each team also has access to an agile coach to enable continuous improvements

### Tribe

This is a collection of squads that work on a specific area, e.g. the frontend guys that works on web, android and ios. It is meant to have less than 100 people.

### Chapter

This is a collection of people across squads in a tribe with similar skills or work in general e.g. JS developers. This allows them to interact and learn from each other

### Guilds

Squads, Tribes and Chapters seems to segregate a lot of the workers. Guilds is the largest group and is meant to comprise of people across the organisation so that they can share knowledge, tools, code, and practices. It is also a way for you to mingle with those outside your field and engender company spirit rather than tribalism

## Product Backlog

A very important scrum artifact is the Product backlog. It is an ordered list of what needs to be done to improve the product and achieve the product goal.
So while you should sort it according to importance, using different models like Kano models, you should also include an estimate of how long it will take.
The product owner is usually in charge of Product backlog.
