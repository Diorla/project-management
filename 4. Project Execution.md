## Tracking progress
There are different ways to track projects, each having its own advantages and disadvantages.

### Gantt Chart
- Keep track of the schedule
- Good for project with lots of tasks, dependencies and milestones
- For large teams because responsibility are clearly laid out

Tools like Asana are good for creating gantt chart, as well as google sheet and microsoft excel

### Roadmaps

- High-level tracking of milestones
- It outlines the whole project and provides snapshot of key points
- It helps the stakeholder view how the project will evolve over time

## Project status report

This gives you an overview of the project's elements and summarises them in snapshots. It should contain the following

1. Project name
2. Date: the status report is made many times throughout the implementation of the project, hence you need attack date. Report should be make regularly  e.g. weekly or monthly
3. Summary: Goals, schedule, highlights and lowlights.
4. Status: Illustrates actual progress, a common way is using RAG (red, amber and green). Red indicates significant issue that may impede or cause the project to go over budget, amber/yellow are usually schedule or budget issues that are minor and can be corrected while green means everything is alright.
5. Milestones and tasks: You don't go into full details, mainly you just indicate **key accomplishments** for completed milestones and **upcoming** for ongoing milestones
6. Issues: current roadblocks and potential risks. Here you can add ROAM analysis

Status report is not just a way to let your stakeholder know what's going on, it is also a way to set expectations for your stakeholder and an opportunity to ask for any resources that you may need.

Status report may be formatted in a variety way. A spreadsheet might be more detailed while a slideshow may be easier to communicate updates

## ROAM analysis

This is used to categorise the current issues facing the project and how they've been handled. there are four categories

1. Resolved: The issue has been fixed, no longer a problem
2. Owned: Someone has been assigned to fix or address it
3. Accepted: There is nothing that can be done about the issue
4. Mitigated: The effect has been reduced
