## Cost benefit analysis

Project cost money, so we need to know if we will get all our money back and more. Hence ROI is key in determining wether a project should get the greenlight

### Why
- Minimizes risks
- Maximizes gains
- Communicates needs and goals to stakeholders
- Reduces biases and self-interests
- Makes project justifiable
- Reduce waste and enable responsible investment

### Questions to ask

Below are possible benefits
- What value the project will create
- How much money would be saved
- How much revenue it will bring
- How much time it will save
- How will it improve customer experience

And then possible cost
- How much time will people spend on this project
- What's the one-time cost
- The ongoing cost
- Long time cost

And there are intangible benefits, that cannot be measured directly
- Customer satisfaction: increases customer retention
- Employee satisfaction: improve morale and reduce turnover
- Employee productivity: Reduce overtime and save money
- Brand perception
You can flip the question to determine intangible cost like reduction in customer satisfaction
