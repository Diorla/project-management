# Module 1

The project has been approved with all the resources needed, now the next step is to kick these off

## Kick-off meeting

This is the beginning of the project from your team's perspective, hence there are some things you need to get right for the meeting

- Set the right time: beware of zone differences
- The right length: It shouldn't be more than 1 hour. Focus on key information, questions and team building
- Invite the right people: You don't want to leave anyone out but shouldn't include those that are not needed
- Designate a note-taker: Documentation is important, tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Docs or Microsoft OneNote will help
- Set the agenda: things like introduction, project background and purpose, goals, scope, roles, responsibilities, collaboration process, project tools and expectations, as well as questions and discussion
- Share the agenda before the meeting. Identify the speakers for each topic
- Follow up after meeting: Send meeting summary to attendee

## Setting Milestones

### Task vs Milestones

Task indicates an activity that needs to be accomplished while milestone indicate an important point in the project schedule, signifying a major deliverable.

A milestone contains 2 or more tasks.

### Defining milestones
Tasks can help you set milestones in one of the following ways
1. Top-down scheduling: Starts with high level milestones and then broken down into tasks
2. Bottom-up scheduling: Grouping together tasks into chunks (milestones).

### Pitfalls
- Too many milestones, this leads to diminished importance of those milestones. It may also make the project look much bigger than it's really is.
- Mistaking tasks for milestones: milestones shouldn't be too small or specific
- Separating tasks and milestones: All tasks should be listed under their milestones to create a visual idea of the project plan


## Work Breakdown Structure

[WBS](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-create-a-work-breakdown-structure-and-why-you-should) helps us visualise the project in hierarchy method. It breaks it down into deliverables and then smaller component

1. Identify the milestones and deliverables
2. Break it down into tasks
3. You can break those tasks into sub tasks
