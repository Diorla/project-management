# Module 1

The project has been approved with all the resources needed, now the next step is to kick these off

## Kick-off meeting

This is the beginning of the project from your team's perspective, hence there are some things you need to get right for the meeting

- Set the right time: beware of zone differences
- The right length: It shouldn't be more than 1 hour. Focus on key information, questions and team building
- Invite the right people: You don't want to leave anyone out but shouldn't include those that are not needed
- Designate a note-taker: Documentation is important, tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Docs or Microsoft OneNote will help
- Set the agenda: things like introduction, project background and purpose, goals, scope, roles, responsibilities, collaboration process, project tools and expectations, as well as questions and discussion
- Share the agenda before the meeting. Identify the speakers for each topic
- Follow up after meeting: Send meeting summary to attendee
