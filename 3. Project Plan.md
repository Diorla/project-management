# Module 1

The project has been approved with all the resources needed, now the next step is to kick these off

## Kick-off meeting

This is the beginning of the project from your team's perspective, hence there are some things you need to get right for the meeting

- Set the right time: beware of zone differences
- The right length: It shouldn't be more than 1 hour. Focus on key information, questions and team building
- Invite the right people: You don't want to leave anyone out but shouldn't include those that are not needed
- Designate a note-taker: Documentation is important, tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Docs or Microsoft OneNote will help
- Set the agenda: things like introduction, project background and purpose, goals, scope, roles, responsibilities, collaboration process, project tools and expectations, as well as questions and discussion
- Share the agenda before the meeting. Identify the speakers for each topic
- Follow up after meeting: Send meeting summary to attendee

## Setting Milestones

### Task vs Milestones

Task indicates an activity that needs to be accomplished while milestone indicate an important point in the project schedule, signifying a major deliverable.

A milestone contains 2 or more tasks.

### Defining milestones
Tasks can help you set milestones in one of the following ways
1. Top-down scheduling: Starts with high level milestones and then broken down into tasks
2. Bottom-up scheduling: Grouping together tasks into chunks (milestones).

### Pitfalls
- Too many milestones, this leads to diminished importance of those milestones. It may also make the project look much bigger than it's really is.
- Mistaking tasks for milestones: milestones shouldn't be too small or specific
- Separating tasks and milestones: All tasks should be listed under their milestones to create a visual idea of the project plan
