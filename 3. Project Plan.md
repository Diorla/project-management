# Module 1

The project has been approved with all the resources needed, now the next step is to kick these off

## Kick-off meeting

This is the beginning of the project from your team's perspective, hence there are some things you need to get right for the meeting

- Set the right time: beware of zone differences
- The right length: It shouldn't be more than 1 hour. Focus on key information, questions and team building
- Invite the right people: You don't want to leave anyone out but shouldn't include those that are not needed
- Designate a note-taker: Documentation is important, tools like Chorus Notetaker, Google Keep, Docs or Microsoft OneNote will help
- Set the agenda: things like introduction, project background and purpose, goals, scope, roles, responsibilities, collaboration process, project tools and expectations, as well as questions and discussion
- Share the agenda before the meeting. Identify the speakers for each topic
- Follow up after meeting: Send meeting summary to attendee

## Setting Milestones

### Task vs Milestones

Task indicates an activity that needs to be accomplished while milestone indicate an important point in the project schedule, signifying a major deliverable.

A milestone contains 2 or more tasks.

### Defining milestones
Tasks can help you set milestones in one of the following ways
1. Top-down scheduling: Starts with high level milestones and then broken down into tasks
2. Bottom-up scheduling: Grouping together tasks into chunks (milestones).

### Pitfalls
- Too many milestones, this leads to diminished importance of those milestones. It may also make the project look much bigger than it's really is.
- Mistaking tasks for milestones: milestones shouldn't be too small or specific
- Separating tasks and milestones: All tasks should be listed under their milestones to create a visual idea of the project plan


## Work Breakdown Structure

[WBS](https://www.lucidchart.com/blog/how-to-create-a-work-breakdown-structure-and-why-you-should) helps us visualise the project in hierarchy method. It breaks it down into deliverables and then smaller component

1. Identify the milestones and deliverables
2. Break it down into tasks
3. You can break those tasks into sub tasks

# Module 2

## Project components
There are four aspects of projects that works hand in hand, all have been addressed so far
1. Scope and goals: Key details of project, usually in the project charter
2. Work Breakdown Structure: Milestones/Deliverables and tasks, as well as RACI chart
3. Budget
4. Management plans: Risk management, Communication plan etc

## Planning fallacy and Optimism bias

This is a field in behavioural economics that suggest that we tend to underestimate the time it will take to complete a task because we are inherently optimistic (most people believes negative things won't happen to them). It can happen to anyone regardless of their experience.
Hence after your initial time assignment, add buffers to it for unforeseen circumstances because it's unforeseeable, and hindsight is 20/20

## Critical Path

The path refers to all the milestones between the project start and completion. This involves the following

1. List all tasks
2. Create dependencies
3. Create network diagram
4. Make time estimates
5. Find the critical path

### Listing tasks
Listing all milestones and capturing all tasks to ensure that nothing is missing. It should focus on the need to do task and create a sort of story or plot.

### Create dependencies
Based on your list, figure out what task needs to be completed before each task can go ahead.

### Network diagrams
This allows you to easily visualise the necessary tasks, see concurrent tasks as well as those with pre-requisites

### Time estimates
Add the time necessary to complete each task

### Determine the critical path
Find the longest possible path to get the basic idea of how long the project will take. You can use the forward or backward pass, this basically mean adding from beginning to end and vice versa.

## Coding tasks

You may have loads of tasks, and some with similar name or too long a statement. Hence it might be a good idea to use task ID numbers or task name. This would make it easier to reference in communication.

## Project plan
This is where all the tasks, task owners, task duration, start and end date. It can be done with a spreadsheet. It helps visualise the project

![project plan](./asset/project%20plan.png)

## Kanban board
You can use a physical board or a software like Trello or Asana. In a physical board, it can be divided into front and back
### Front
- Title and unique identifier
- Description of work
- Estimation of effort: amount of work required
- Who is assigned
### Back
- Start date
- Blocked date: Moments that you cannot work on the task for any reason
- Finish date
